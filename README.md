# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition with Temporal Muscle Activation Maps



This repository containes the source code for the real-time hand gesture recognition algorithm based on Temporal Muscle Activation (TMA) maps of multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, which was published in the ICASSP 2020 paper [Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Temporal Muscle Activation Maps of Multi-Channel Semg Signals](10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054227). An application of this work -- wearable wireless dry contact sEMG sensor system for controlling digital technologies -- received an honorable mention (ranked among top 15 projects in the world) at the IEEE Communication Society Student Competition 2019.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
